## Daily Micro-Projects

This repository contains small daily projects to practice and demonstrate:
- PHP backend scripting
- JavaScript utilities
- AJAX-style async logic
- JSON and XML data handling
- Clean Git workflow with branches and pull requests

Each project is intentionally small, focused, and self-contained.
